# 🎬 Movie Booking Database Project (SQL)

### 📘 Project Overview
This project focuses on building and analyzing a **Movie Booking System** using **SQL**.  
The goal is to design a relational database, clean and organize raw data, and run SQL queries to extract meaningful insights about **movies, customers, bookings, and payments**.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Design a normalized database structure for movie bookings  
- Import and clean data from Excel  
- Write SQL queries to:
  - Retrieve booking and movie details  
  - Analyze customer behavior  
  - Track revenue and performance  
- Demonstrate use of joins, subqueries, aggregate functions, and views

### 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Database design and normalization  
- SQL CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)  
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)  
- Table joins and relationships  
- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Report generation using SQL

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite | Database management |
| Excel | Raw data source |
| SQL Workbench / DBeaver | Query execution |
| GitHub | Project documentation & version control |

### ⚙️ Project Steps
1. Data Understanding – Analyzed the provided Excel dataset  
2. Database Design – Created tables:
   - movies
   - customers
   - bookings
   - payments
3. Data Import – Loaded cleaned Excel data into SQL tables  
4. Data Cleaning – Ensured no null or duplicate records  
5. SQL Analysis – Wrote and executed queries to answer key business questions such as:
   - Which movie generated the highest revenue?  
   - Which customers made the most bookings?  
   - What is the monthly revenue trend?  
   - Which genre is most popular?

### 📈 Results
- Built a clean and relational database structure  
- Improved data accessibility through optimized queries  
- Derived insights on customer behavior and movie performance  

### 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add stored procedures and triggers  
- Integrate with Power BI or Tableau for dashboard visualization  
- Create a Python or web-based front end to interact with the database
